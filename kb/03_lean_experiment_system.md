# Lean Experiment System

**Definition**: A rigorous process to validate assumptions before scaling spend.

## The Loop
**Hypothesis -> Build -> Measure -> Learn**

## Experiment Card Template
1. **Hypothesis**: "We believe that [Target Audience] will [Action] because [Reason]."
2. **Experiment**: "We will [Tactical Action: send email, run ad, etc.]."
3. **Metric**: "We are right if [Number] people do [Action]."
4. **Cost**: Time + Money.

## Hierarchy of Evidence (Weak -> Strong)
1. **Opinion**: "I think this will work."
2. **Engagement**: "They clicked the ad."
3. **Promise**: "They gave us their email/phone."
4. **Skin in the Game**: "They paid a deposit."

## 5 Practical Rules (Updated)
*(Will be updated based on log patterns)*
1. **Speed > Perfection**: A rough implementation today is better than a perfect one next month.
2. **One Variable**: Test headline OR image. Not both at once.
3. **Kill Quickly**: If it fails the metrics, stop. Don't fall in love with the idea.
4. **Nigeria Context**: WhatsApp is a valid testing channel. Manual outreach often beats automated emails for initial B2B trust.
5. **Measure the Drop-off**: Where did they stop? That's your bottleneck.
