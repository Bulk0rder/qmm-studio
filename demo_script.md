# QMM Studio - Demo Script (3 Minutes)

**Audience**: Creative Director / CMO
**Goal**: Prove this isn't just "another tool", but a strategic weapon.

---

### Minute 1: The Problem (0:00 - 1:00)
*Open the App Home Page.*

"Chief, we usually start campaigns with a 'cool idea'. Then we pray it works. That's risky."
"I built the **Quantum Marketing Studio**. It doesn't guess. It uses a physics engine: **JTBD** (Why they buy), **AIDA** (How we talk), and **Lean** (How we test)."

*Click 'New Scenario'.*

"Let's say the Board just cut our budget, but targets are the same. A classic 'Do More With Less' nightmare."
*Type 'Budget cut 30%, need to maintain acquisition' into the input.*
"Watch this."

### Minute 2: The Solution (1:00 - 2:00)
*Click 'Generate Blueprint'. Show the Output Page.*

"It didn't just give me generic advice. Look at the **Strategy Core**."
*Point to Strategy Card.*
"It recommends a 'Retention Fortress' strategy. Why? because acquiring new customers is 5x more expensive. It detected the budget constraint and pivoted to efficiency."

"Now look at the **Messaging Pack**."
*Show Messaging Card.*
"It generated compliance-safe copy. 'Don't fight on price, fight on value.' It even flagged the 'Terms apply' requirement because we selected Banking mode."

### Minute 3: The Proof (2:00 - 3:00)
*Click 'Save to Tracker'.*

"This is where we win. We don't just launch and hope. We log experiments."
*Show Tracker Page.*
"We test the headline. If it hits the KPI, we scale. If not, we kill it in 48 hours. No wasted budget."

"This tool turns us from 'Creative Guessers' to 'Revenue Architects'. Shall we run the first scenario?"
