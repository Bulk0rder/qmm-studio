# Growth Metrics & KPI

**Definition**: The scoreboard.

## North Star Metric
The single metric that best captures the core value delivered to your customers.
- **Example (Bank)**: "Verifiable Weekly Deposits" (not just app downloads).

## The Pirate Metrics (AARRR) - Adapted for QMM
1. **Acquisition**: CPA (Cost Per Acquisition).
2. **Activation**: % of sign-ups who take the "First Key Action".
3. **Retention**: Churn Rate / Retention Rate (Cohort Analysis).
4. **Referral**: Viral Coefficient (K-factor).
5. **Revenue**: LTV (Lifetime Value) / ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).

## Common Mistakes
- **Vanity**: "Total Registered Users" (Cumulative counts always go up).
- **Lagging vs Leading**: Revenue is lagging. "Usage this week" is leading. Focus on leading.
