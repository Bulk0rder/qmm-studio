## How to add a new Doc
1. Create a new Markdown file: `12_your_topic.md`.
2. Copy the frontmatter from `style_guide.md`.
3. Write your content.
4. Add an entry to `index.json`.

## Structure
- **Frameworks**: The theory (JTBD, Lean).
- **Playbooks**: The practice (AIDA, Channels).
- **Policies**: The rules (Compliance).
- **Scenarios**: The database of situations.

## Index
The `index.json` file is used by the App to search and retrieve content. If you add a file but don't add it to the index, the App won't see it.
