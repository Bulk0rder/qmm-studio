# Messaging Patterns

**Definition**: Standardized structures for writing copy that converts.

## 1. PAS (Problem - Agitation - Solution)
- **Problem**: "Transfer fees are eating your profit."
- **Agitation**: "That's N5000 every month just for moving your own money."
- **Solution**: "Zero transfer fees with QMM Bank."

## 2. BAB (Before - After - Bridge)
- **Before**: "Struggling to track expenses?"
- **After**: "Imagine seeing every kobo accounted for automatically."
- **Bridge**: "Get the QMM Expense Tracker."

## 3. Four U's (Headlines)
- **Urgent**: "Sale ends tonight."
- **Unique**: "The only bank that pays *you* to save."
- **Ultra-specific**: "Save N45,000 / year."
- **Useful**: "How to stop losing money."
