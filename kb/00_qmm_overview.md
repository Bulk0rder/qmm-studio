# Quantum Marketing Model (QMM)

**Definition**: QMM is a unified operating system for growth that combines **Jobs To Be Done (Why they buy)**, **Lean Startup (How we validate)**, and **AIDA (How we communicate)** into a single verified loop.

## Why "Quantum"?
Marketing is often seen as "art" (indefinite). QMM treats it as physics:
- **Input**: A clear customer job.
- **Process**: Rapid experimentation.
- **Output**: Predictable revenue.

## The Triad
1. **JTBD**: We don't sell products; we sell "better versions of the customer."
2. **AIDA Chat**: Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action. The immutable laws of persuasion.
3. **Lean Loop**: Build -> Measure -> Learn. If you can't measure it, you didn't do it.

## When to use QMM
- Launching a new product in an uncertain market.
- Diagnosis: "Why did this campaign fail?"
- Alignment: Getting Product, Sales, and Brand on one page.

## Failure Modes
- **Skipping JTBD**: Jumping straight to "cool creative" without knowing the "Job".
- **Vanity Metrics**: Measuring "Likes" instead of "Sales/Signups".
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Planning for 6 months instead of shipping a test in 6 days.
