# AIDA Playbook

**Definition**: The sequential funnel every customer mind must pass through: Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action.

## 1. Attention (The Hook)
- **Goal**: Stop the scroll.
- **Tools**: Pattern interrupts, bold claims, questions.
- **Nigeria Context**: Use local slang (carefully) or address "pain points" immediately (e.g., "Stop losing money to downtime").

## 2. Interest (The Bridge)
- **Goal**: Keep them reading. Connect the hook to their reality.
- **Technique**: "You know how [Problem]? Well, we [Solution]..."
- **Fact**: The average user gives you 3 seconds after the hook.

## 3. Desire (The Proof)
- **Goal**: Make them *want* it.
- **Tools**: Social proof, case studies, specific numbers ("Save 30%", not "Save money").
- **Safety**: In regulated sectors, rely on *verifiable* features, not emotional puffery.

## 4. Action (The Ask)
- **Goal**: The click, the sign-up, the buy.
- **Rule**: Be singular. One button. One instruction.
- **CTA Examples**: "Get Strategy", "Book Demo", "Start Saving".

## Common Failure Modes
- **All Attention, No Desire**: Clickbait that bounces.
- **Weak Action**: "Learn more" (boring) vs "See your savings" (value-based).
