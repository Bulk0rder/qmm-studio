# QMM Governance Checklist

**Ensure all AI-generated claims are verified against the source of truth.**

Trust is the currency of sustainable growth. AI hallucinations or unchecked aggressive copy can destroy brand equity in minutes.

## The Governance Layer
Every blueprint must pass the Trust & Governance check before deployment.

### 1. Truth in Advertising
- [ ] Can every claim be substantiated by internal data?
- [ ] Are comparative claims (cleaner, faster, better) legally defensible?

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] Does the copy adhere to industry specific regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SEC)?
- [ ] Are disclaimers present where required?

### 3. Brand Safety
- [ ] Is the tone consistent with the brand voice?
- [ ] Does the sequence respect user consent and privacy?

## Stop Rules
If any "High Risk" item fails, the experiment is **aborted** immediately.
