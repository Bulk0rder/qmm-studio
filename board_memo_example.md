# MEMORANDUM

**TO**: Board of Directors / EXCO
**FROM**: Marketing Leadership
**DATE**: December 23, 2025
**SUBJECT**: Strategic Response to Budget Contraction - "Project Efficiency"

---

## 1. Objective
To maintain Q3 customer acquisition targets (15k New Users) despite a 30% reduction in media spend.

## 2. Diagnosis
Our current cost-per-acquisition (CPA) is bloated by broad targeting and low-converting "Brand Awareness" ads. With the new budget reality, we cannot afford "air cover". We must shift to "ground combat" (Direct Response).

## 3. Guiding Policy (Strategy)
**"Retention as the New Acquisition."**
We will pivot 60% of resources to **Up-selling existing inactive users** (Cost: N500/user) rather than chasing cold leads (Cost: N3,500/user). For cold acquisition, we will move from Image Ads to High-Intent Search Ads.

## 4. Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1.  **Pause**: All "Brand Awareness" billboards and YouTube generic ads. (Savings: N15M)
2.  **Launch**: "Win-Back" Email & SMS campaign targeting users dormant for >90 days.
3.  **Optimize**: Revamp the landing page with the new "Value-First" messaging (tested via QMM Blueprint).

## 5. KPIs & Measurement
-   **Primary**: Blended CPA (Target: < N2,000).
-   **Secondary**: 30-Day Churn Rate.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
-   **Risk**: Lower visibility may hurt long-term brand recall.
-   **Mitigation**: We will maintain low-cost "pulse" presence on social media via organic content, focusing spend only on conversion.
