# The Law of Non-Commutativity

**Order matters. Value must precede Price.**

In marketing physics, operations are non-commutative. $A + B \neq B + A$.

- **Scenario 1**: You see the price ($500), then you see the value (It solves your biggest problem). Result: "Too expensive."
- **Scenario 2**: You see the value (It solves your biggest problem), then you see the price ($500). Result: "Worth it."

## Why it happens
The brain anchors on the first piece of significant information. If the anchor is cost, everything following is viewed through a lens of loss aversion. If the anchor is gain, the cost is viewed as an investment.

## Checklist
- [ ] Is the price hidden until value is established?
- [ ] Is the "Ask" made only after the "Give"?
- [ ] Do we validate the user's intent before requiring effort?
