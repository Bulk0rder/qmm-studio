# Scenario Catalog

A database of common business situations and their QMM prescriptions.

---

## Group 1: Internal Advocacy (Bank Focus)

### 1. The "Compliance Blocker"
- **Situation**: Legal rejects every campaign idea as "too risky."
- **Objective**: Get a bold campaign approved without being watered down.
- **Constraints**: 0 risk tolerance, strict CBN guidelines.
- **QMM Path**: JTBD (Compliance Shield) -> AIDA (Safe Desire).
- **Experiments**:
    - Internal "Pre-Mortem" Workshop.
    - Test messaging on a small "whitelist" employee group first.
- **Messaging**: Don't say "Best Rate". Say "Market-Leading Rates*" (*Terms apply).

### 2. The "Budget Slash" Defense
- **Situation**: CFO wants to cut marketing spend by 30% due to FX issues.
- **Objective**: Defend the budget or pivot to high-efficiency channels.
- **Constraints**: ROI must be proven in 30 days.
- **QMM Path**: Lean (Efficiency Audit) -> JTBD (Retention).
- **Best Metric**: Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) vs LTV.
- **Micro-Experiment**: Turn off "Brand Awareness" ads for 1 week. Measure dip in direct traffic.

### 3. The "Legacy Product" Push
- **Situation**: Product team built a complex app feature nobody uses. Wants Marketing to "fix it."
- **Objective**: Prove if it's a feature problem or a marketing problem.
- **Constraints**: No dev resources to change the product.
- **QMM Path**: JTBD (Re-framing).
- **Hypothesis**: Users don't understand the *value*, not the *feature*.
- **Experiment**: Email campaign focusing *only* on the outcome, not the screen.

### 4. The "Data Blindness" Cure
- **Situation**: Board demands "Growth" but we have no clean data attribution.
- **Objective**: Implement a learning loop before spending big.
- **QMM Path**: Lean (Metric Setup).
- **Action**: Install basic event tracking (PostHog/GA4) on the critical path *only*. Don't track everything.

### 5. The "Silo Breaker"
- **Situation**: Sales says leads are bad. Marketing says Sales is lazy.
- **Objective**: Align teams on "What is a Lead".
- **QMM Path**: JTBD (Sales needs Confidence).
- **Experiment**: "Sales-defined Lead" test. Have Sales grade the last 10 leads. Calibrate.

## Group 2: Launch

### 6. The "Silent Launch"
- **Situation**: New product ready. No audience.
- **Objective**: Get first 100 users.
- **Strategy**: Direct Outreach (Linkedin/Email). Don't run ads yet.

### 7. The "Crowded Market" Entry
- **Situation**: Competitors are established. You are unknown.
- **Objective**: Steal attention.
- **Strategy**: AIDA (Disruptive Attention). "They charge X, we charge Y" (Comparative).

### 8. The "Feature Drop"
- **Situation**: Adding a requested feature to existing product.
- **Objective**: Upsell existing users.
- **Strategy**: Email sequence. "You asked, we listened."

## Group 3: Conversion Fix

### 9. The "High Traffic, Low Sign-up"
- **Situation**: Blog gets hits, app gets none.
- **Diagnosis**: Weak "Desire" or Friction in "Action".
- **Fix**: Simplify the form. Add social proof near the button.

### 10. The "Onboarding Drop-off"
- **Situation**: Sign-ups happen, but activation (first transaction) doesn't.
- **Fix**: Email/SMS nudge within 1 hour. "Need help?"

### 11. The "Cart Abandonment"
- **Situation**: Items added, purchase not completed.
- **Fix**: Remarketing + Email. "Did life get in the way?"

---

## Group 4: Competitive Counterpunch

### 12. The "Price War"
- **Situation**: Competitor drops price 50%.
- **Objective**: Retain customers without destroying margins.
- **Strategy**: JTBD (Service/Quality). Remind them *why* they pay more.

### 13. The "Copycat"
- **Situation**: Competitor clones your feature.
- **Strategy**: Brand narrative. "The Original."

### 14. The "FUD Attack"
- **Situation**: Competitor spreads rumors (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).
- **Strategy**: Transparency. Open webinar/AMA.

---

## Group 5: Reputation & Trust

### 15. The "Service Outage" Apology
- **Situation**: System went down. Users angry.
- **Strategy**: Radical Ownership. "We failed. Here is how we fix it."

### 16. The "Bad Review" Cluster
- **Situation**: Viral complaint on Twitter.
- **Strategy**: Move to DM. Solve publically if solved well.

---

## Group 6: Budget Cuts / Efficiency

### 17. The "Paid Channel Fatigue"
- **Situation**: Ads getting expensive (CPA rising).
- **Strategy**: Creative Refresh. Content experimentation.

### 18. The "Organic Pivot"
- **Situation**: Ad budget zeroed.
- **Strategy**: SEO + Community. High effort, long term.
