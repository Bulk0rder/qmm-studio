# Principled Sequencing (A/Z Tests)

**Testing the order of information (A/Z) is more impactful than testing the asset design (A/B).**

When dealing with complex decisions, the *sequence* in which information is presented determines the customer's ability to process it. A "Value First, Price Last" sequence performs fundamentally different from a "Price First, Value Last" sequence.

## Core Concept
Instead of testing button colors (A/B), test the narrative arc (A/Z).

### The A/Z Framework
- **Variant A**: The standard "Best Practice" flow.
- **Variant Z**: The "Inverse" or "Challenger" flow based on a specific behavioral hypothesis.

## Application
1. **Identify the core constraint**: Is it price sensitivity? Trust? Confusion?
2. **Hypothesize the sequence**: If price is the barrier, put Value *and* Social Proof before Price.
3. **Measure throughput**: Does the challenger sequence move more people to the final step?
