# Compliance & Claims Safety

**Definition**: How to sell hard without getting sued or fined.

## The Golden Rules
1. **Truth**: Never say it if you can't prove it.
2. **Clarity**: Fine print cannot contradict the headline.
3. **Fairness**: Don't exploit fear or ignorance.

## Red Flag Words (Banking/Crypto/Health)
- **Avoid**: "Guaranteed", "Risk-Free", "Instant", "100%", "Best".
- **Use Instead**: "Potential", "Secure", "Fast", "Leading", "Top-Rated".

## Safe Messaging Patterns

### The "Help" Frame
- **Risky**: "We make you rich."
- **Safe**: "We help you manage your wealth."

### The "Constraint" Frame
- **Risky**: "Get a loan in 5 minutes."
- **Safe**: "Loans processed in as little as 5 minutes*." (*Terms apply)

### The "Testimonial" Frame
- **Risky**: "You will earn 20% returns."
- **Safe**: "John earned 20% returns last year (Past performance is not indicative of future results)."

## Nigerian Specifics (ARCON / CBN)
- Must display license number on ads.
- "Terms and Conditions Apply" must be legible.
- Crypto assets are not insured by NDIC (Standard warning).
